## I am a first-year philosophy student at Wheaton College.

I will be posting papers as I go along, with an eventual emphasis on the intersection of philosophy and medicine.

**Spring 2022**

This spring, my only philosophy class is Intro to Logic, which doesn't involve too many papers. Check back next semester.

**Fall 2021**
