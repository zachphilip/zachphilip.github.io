## I am a first-year philosophy student at Wheaton College.

I am broadly interested in philosophy, theology, and medicine and will be posting papers as I go along. At this point, the papers listed below are work done for introductory-level English, history, and philosophy classes. 

**Spring 2022**

[Acts 17:16-34 as a Model for Evangelistic Engagement with Philosophy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GneBbJqTSqWNREOuVp7exc2az54F5MPw0FyphPYAjY0/edit?usp=sharing) For BITH 213 (New Testament Literature & Interpretation). Final paper examining St. Paul's engagement with Greco-Roman philosophy and applying his message as a model for modern Christian engagement with philosophy, with a discussion of the limitations of this approach. 

[Epicurean and Stoic Views of the Divine and Resurrection](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tm9HlAg-ohoZlI60SQ9O9E2qOinaZnuS5yxI8WCRbbA/edit?usp=sharing) For BITH 213 (New Testament Literature & Interpretation). Chosen as the example paper for next semester's class. 

[Much Ado About Nothing Scene Analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q_aeP9QQ2jORBRAYw2Hy9phHHK-L7QUzoo64f72SjLg/edit?usp=sharing). For ENGL 112 (Studies in Western Literature: Comedy and Tragedy). Short paper comparing choices and effects from Beatrice's and Benedick's dialogue in Act 1 of _Much Ado_ in the Branagh and Whedon films.

**Fall 2021**

[Summary and evaluation of Glaucon's view of justice in Book II of the Republic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UGpV75qY1NKw7auDt25fCovtOkKyZzk-/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102486413588053825109&rtpof=true&sd=true) For PHIL 101 (Introduction to Philosophy). Professor comments: "Your evaluation of Glaucon's arguments is the best I have ever seen. A little more detail in answering the questions I asked would have resulted in an even higher score."
