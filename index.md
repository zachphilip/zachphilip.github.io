## I'm a junior philosophy major at Wheaton College (IL).

I'm using this page, first, as a sort of barebones blog, and, second, to keep papers that I've wrote organized. (Functionally, it's just a bunch of links to Google Docs.)

**Non-Academic Writing**

**Fall 2023**

[Truth, Consolation, and Active Love in the Lives of Zosima and Don Manuel](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mXTPFtjOq9zO652_urGYSl47ikWVXGVjMN-WFlgbUUw/edit?usp=sharing). For CORE 372 (Existentialism). Midterm paper that compared Zosima's (from the Brothers Karamazov) and Don Manuel's (from Saint Manuel Bueno, Martyr) conception of the nature and role of active love.  

[The Unique Identity Formation of the Cochin Jews and Thomas Christians](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_tkSqOJdrMoFsGge_eRrLC_xSeLLjtNdrZCBtLHKdtc/edit?usp=sharing). For RELI 356 (The Jewish Tradition). Final paper that (1) discussed the experience of the Cochin Jews in India as 'fully Indian and fully Jewish,' with particular attention to what made India and Hinduism hospitable to Jews and how Jews balanced halakhah with cultural assimilation; (2) considered  parallels with the Thomas Christians; and (3) expanded on the insularity of these communities (which was in tension with their faiths), proposing a possible answer.

**Spring 2023**

[St. Thomas & The Thomas Christians](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uC3S-51Grevd51wDOn4DxWr3LhaqfmscS5Eb6pJ2zfI/edit?usp=sharing). For ART 352 (Medieval & Byzantine Art). Final paper that (1) presented and defended the idea that Thomas the Apostle personally evangelized India; and (2) considered the heritage of the Thomas Christians, discussing what it means for Thomas Christians to be—and a possible limitation of being—'Hindu in culture, Christian in faith, and Syrian in polity, rituals and doctrines.' 

[Summary and evaluation of C. S. Lewis's _Problem of Pain_ Ch. 1-5](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10l8Pba7OTAIZGdeKUuwJU3B9YJSUl8aT1TP8oGvtQM0/edit?usp=sharing). For PHIL 241 (Suffering). Midterm paper presenting and analyzing Lewis's presentation and proposed solution to the problem of pain. Highest score in class; used as example paper. Professor comments: "This is a very nice piece of work. You make virtually no significant missteps in recapitulating Lewis’s line of reasoning, and you have obviously profited from the classroom discussion. I’ve made small emendations to your wording where I think they improve your claims."

**Fall 2022**

[Augustine’s Otherworldly Happiness](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Lvi6FZG_0j34ON5ygyDdCVwqWpyCG2sdguIwOHrW8g/edit?usp=sharing). For PHIL 311 (History of Philosophy: Ancient & Medieval). Final paper analyzing Augustine's view on happiness, and defending it, e.g., against L. A. Paul's potential "blind leap" objection.

[The “Delightful Drama” of Exchange in Luther’s Freedom of a Christian](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wWT00AZDPhzWyEl_Q3aZlPfX8fGhcE_VroLWYqh_2Vo/edit?usp=sharing). For BITH 372 (Historical Theology). Final paper presenting and defending Luther's language of the exchange between the soul and Christ.

**Spring 2022**

[Acts 17:16-34 as a Model for Evangelistic Engagement with Philosophy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GneBbJqTSqWNREOuVp7exc2az54F5MPw0FyphPYAjY0/edit?usp=sharing) For BITH 213 (New Testament Literature & Interpretation). Final paper examining St. Paul's engagement with Greco-Roman philosophy and applying his message as a model for modern Christian engagement with philosophy, with a discussion of the limitations of this approach. 

[Epicurean and Stoic Views of the Divine and Resurrection](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tm9HlAg-ohoZlI60SQ9O9E2qOinaZnuS5yxI8WCRbbA/edit?usp=sharing) For BITH 213 (New Testament Literature & Interpretation). Chosen as the example paper for next semester's class. 


**Fall 2021**

[Summary and evaluation of Glaucon's view of justice in Book II of the Republic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UGpV75qY1NKw7auDt25fCovtOkKyZzk-/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102486413588053825109&rtpof=true&sd=true) For PHIL 101 (Introduction to Philosophy). Professor comments: "Your evaluation of Glaucon's arguments is the best I have ever seen. A little more detail in answering the questions I asked would have resulted in an even higher score."
